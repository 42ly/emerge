# emerge
A game engine written in SDL2/C++. Currently all that's implemented is the animation of a julia fractal and a static mandelbrot fractal. The animation of the julia fractal shows an interesting occurence of biomorphic mitosis. Meaning that this julia fractal resembles/sort of models cellular mitosis when iterated over a constant on the julia set function. The colors are randomly selected.
